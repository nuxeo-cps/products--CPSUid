CPSUid - Uid generation
=======================

Uid generation is done according to a portal type for now: that's the only
criterion used to find out which generator should be used.

Each generator holds counters given other criteria so that we can build
uniques identifiers like 'S-YY-NNN' with:

- S: code identifying the document source (for instance)
- YY: current year
- NNN: document number created from the counter

So in this case we would have a counter per source and year.
